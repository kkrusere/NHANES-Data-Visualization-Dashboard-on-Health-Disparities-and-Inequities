    "# **Project Outline**\n",
    "Problem Statement: The NHANES data is a rich collection of demographics, socioeconomic, dietary, and health-related data. Exploratory Data Analysis of this data can provide some insight into the US Health System and the resulting Health Outcomes of the system. This can also be Used to shed light on and Investigate Health Disparities/Inequities in the Healthcare System. However, if you do not possess the technical know-how on extracting, analyzing, and visualizing NHANES data, for example, knowledge of SAS (an innovative Analytics, Artificial Intelligence, and Data Management software), which is the format that the data is in, I would imagine that if youâ€™re not some sort of a Data Analyst or Data Scientist the data is useless. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal/idea or solution that is being presented by the research project is an interactive data visualization tool on the NHANES data. This  User-friendly, no need for IT support, interactive Data Visualization tool/dashboard. This would Aid anyone with an internet connection (so  doctors, nurses, healthcare professionals and providers, health insurance providers, Health Department officials, regular people, etc.) to visualize, gain insight from the data, and make data-driven decisions on the subject matter (Health disparities and inequities). \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Project Objectve/Define Business Requirement** \n",
    "  > Creating an Interactive Data Visualisation (Dashboard) of the NHANES data using Python and Streamlit.\n",
    "2. **Data Collecton**\n",
    "  > Since we dont have access to the database where the NHANES data s housed, we are going to devise a plan to programatically down load the data from the NHANES website. As stated we are going to look at selected Data Files that have a direct relation to the subject matter and is present in at least 9 cycles (the survey cycles) starting from 1999 to 2018.\n",
    "3. **Data Cleaning and Preparation** \n",
    "  > This is going to involve first, cleaning each data file per survey cycle, then joining the same data files from each cycle to gether. The data cleaning will also involve determining which features/attributes/columns in the data files are of mosts relevance to the subject matter. Then we will create a table/dataframe that have the the `\"SAS Label\"` licked to the data file columns. Finally here, we will merge all the data files in to one dataframe using the `\"SEQN - Respondent sequence number\"` as the reference. Since some of the columns are numerically encoded, another Data frame is going to be create that links the `\"Code or Value\"` of each column to its `\"Value Description\"`.\n",
    "4. **Data Exploration and Analysis**\n",
    "  > EDA is the process of performing investigations on data to discover patterns, anomalies, testing hypothesis and cheking assumptions, which we might intially have of the data, using summary statistics and graphical representations. This part of the project is basically for exploring/investigating the data and figuring out what we can do with it. Here, we will explore the different visualizations that we can create from the data and what insight can be generalized from these Visualization (and the data at large).\n",
